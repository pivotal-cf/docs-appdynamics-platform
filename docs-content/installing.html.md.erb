owner: Partners
---

This topic describes how to install and configure AppDynamics Platform Monitoring for Pivotal Cloud Foundry (PCF).
The tile allows you to deploy  AppDynamics Firehose Nozzle that collects various KPI metrics and a Dashboard that
automatically creates health rules and custom dashboards associated with the metrics.

Additionally the tile allows for advanced configuration to customize metric collection, configuring
multi-foundation dashboard and overiding default configurations.

<p class="note warning"><strong>WARNING:</strong> Starting with 4.6 version the default AppDynamics Nozzle Application Name
has been changed to <strong>appd-nozzle-v2</strong> and a new dashboard with name <strong>appd-nozzle-v2-<{cf system domain}>-PCF KPI Dashboard</strong>
will be created.
</p>

## <a id='overview-appd-nozzle'></a> Overview

The tile deploys an AppDynamics Nozzle and Dashboard App as PCF apps to the org and space
appdynamics-org/appdynamics-space. The diagram illustrates the AppDynamics Nozzle that is
deployed by the tile. The Nozzle aggregates and forwards metrics from the 
**Loggregator [Firehose](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/loggregator/architecture.html#firehose)** to
the AppDynamics Controller. The metrics are published in the Controller as custom metrics under the
default application name, appd-nozzle-v2, and tier that corresponds to the system domain of the PCF
foundation.

The Dashboard App deployed by the tile will automatically create a set of KPI health rules and a
Single Foundation dashboard in the controller configured in the Nozzle Configuration, which reflect
the health and capacity of the foundation where the tile is installed.

In addition, based on optional configuration added in the tile under AppDynamics Dashboard
Configuration, the Dashboard App will create one or more Multi-Foundation Dashboards. These
dashboards summarize the health and capacity of multiple foundations, assuming each foundation
has the AppDynamics Platform Monitoring for PCF tile installed, and each tile is configured to report
to the same AppDynamics controller, as indicated in the diagram.

* **Enable Controller SSL**: Establishes secures communication with the Controller.
* **AppDynamics Controller Proxy**: Proxy url, if necessary, used by the Nozzle and Dashboard App to communicate with the AppDynamics Controller. Example: `https://user:password@proxy.com:9000`

### <a id='Nozzle Credentials'></a> Nozzle Credentials
* Cloud Foundry (CF) environments usually ship with an **opentsdb-firehose-nozzle** account which already belongs to the doppler.firehose group.
      To use the existing opentsdb-firehose-nozzle account shipped with CF, log in to the OPS Manager and select the PAS tile and navigate to credentials > UAA > **Opentsdb Nozzle Credentials**
      and copy the username and password.
* (or) Create a new account in the doppler.firehose group with the correct permissions.
      For more information, see [UAA Client](https://github.com/cf-platform-eng/firehose-nozzle#option-2-uaa-client).

### <a id='dashboard configuration'></a> AppDynamics Dashboard Configuration

This form takes in information to create a Dashboard and associated health rules on the AppDynamics Controller

![Settings tab for AppDynamics Dashboard Configuration](./images/dashboard_config.png)

* **Username for Reporting Custom Dashboard**: Username of an account with custom dashboard creation permissions.
* **Password**: Password for the Controller account.

Refer this section for setting up a [controller account with required permissions](kpi_dashboard.html#dashboard-app)

#### <a id='configuration'></a> Multi-foundation Dashboard Configuration (Optional)

The Multi-foundation Dashboard configuration supports creating a single dashboard that
displays the health and performance of multiple foundations. Each foundation that is included
must have the platform tile installed and configure the Nozzle to report to the same controller.

One Multi-foundation Dashboard is created for each configuration added in the Multi-
foundation Dashboard Configurations section. In the example below, ‘all-foundations’ is the
name of the new configuration, and will be prepended to the name of the dashboard created in
the controller, which uses the format &lt;config name&gt;-PCF Multi-foundation Dashboard.

![](./images/08multidashboardconfig.png)

The ‘Application regex’ and ‘Tier regex’ should match one or more app/tier combinations where
AppDynamics Nozzles are reporting. Based on the default app and tier, the example uses ‘appd-
nozzle-v2’ as the app regex, and sys.* as the tier regex, which will match any system domain.

The ‘Dashboard layout selection’ defaults to ‘Auto select layout’ where the Dashboard App will
select a layout with the appropriate number of foundations per row based on the total number
of foundations discovered. Or a specific layout can be chosen to control the density of the
created dashboard.

Below are examples of the ‘Two foundations per row’ and ‘Four foundations per row’ layouts.

![Four foundations per row layout](./images/09fourfoundation.png)

### <a id='Advanced metrics collection'></a> (Optional) Extending Metrics Collection

Starting with the 4.6.* version of the tile we have included a feature to collect additional metrics in addition to
the default standard KPI metrics that are collected by AppDynamics Nozzle.

![Settings tab for AppDynamics Advanced Metrics](./images/advanced_metrics.png)

* **Collect Container Metrics**: Check this box to collect Container metrics for the applications.

* **Extended Metrics JSON Filter**: AppDynamics Nozzle aplies a filter to limit the number of metrics that are processed. This JSON configures
the filter. It is a simple JSON dictionary with metrics `origin` tag used as keys and the list of `names` of metrics that belong to the `origin` that are to be collected as value.
Additionally, a wildcard `"*"` can also be used inside the list to collect all metrics under the `origin`.

```json
{
    "<origin>":["<MetricName1>", "<MetricName2>"],
    "<origin>":["*"]
}
```

e.g: Consider this metric with `origin` set to `uaa` with `name` `audit_service.principal_not_found_count`

```bash
origin:"uaa" eventType:ValueMetric timestamp:1553201379027067175 deployment:"cf" job:"uaa" index:"1e586719-7e22-4cb4-944d-2176db9e01b8"
 ip:"192.168.16.21" tags:<key:"source_id" value:"uaa" >
 valueMetric:<name:"audit_service.principal_not_found_count" value:0 unit:"gauge" >
```
to report the metric the filter entry will be

```json
{
    "uaa": ["audit_service.principal_not_found_count"]
}
```

### <a id='Overriding Defaults'></a> (Optional) Overriding Defaults

<p class="note"> For 4.4.x controllers it is mandatory to override the default Application, Tier, Tier ID and Node values.

![Settings tab for AppDynamics Default Overrides](./images/default_config.png)

* **UAA Token Endpoint**: UAA token end point of the cloudfoundry. This can be found by doing `$ cf curl /v2/info | grep token_endpoint`
* **Nozzle Application Name**: Enter a name to identify the Nozzle Application on the Controller, such as **_test-app-nozzle_**.
* **Nozzle Tier Name**: Enter a name for the Nozzle Tier that corresponds to the Nozzle Application Name, such as **_test-app-tier_**. This MUST be a Go SDK Tier.
* **Nozzle Node Name**: Enter a name for the Nozzle Node that corresponds to the Nozzle Application Name, such as **_test-app-node_**.
* **Nozzle Tier ID**: Enter the component ID of the GoLang SDK tier.

#### <a id='44x Controllers'></a> 4.4.x Controllers
For 4.4.x controller, please create an applicaiton on the AppDynamics Controller and create a `Go SDK` tier associated with that application and record the tier-id.
Enter the AppDynamics AppName, Tier, TierID and Node names in the corresponding fields of the **Overriding Defaults** form.

## <a id='validate-install'></a> Validating an Install

### <a id='Nozzle Credentials'></a> Validating the Nozzle

Once the tile install completes successfully in the Ops Manager, confirm that the Nozzle is reporting
metrics to the controller by navigating to the appd-nozzle-v2 app and opening the Metric Browser. If
the Nozzle is successfully reporting metrics, it will create the path `Application Infrastructure
Performance|<tier>|Custom Metrics|PCF Firehose Monitor`, where the tier corresponds to the system
domain of the PCF foundation. Navigate to a specific metric such as Diego Cell
Metrics|rep|cf|diego_cell|<guid>|rep. CapacityRemainingMemory as shown below, and doubleclick it to
add it to the timeseries graph and confirm metrics are reporting in the last 5 minutes.

![](./images/pcf-foundation-05.png)

If the metrics don’t appear, use the Apps Manager to tail the logs for the Nozzle `appdnozzle-
<version>` under appdynamics-org/appdynamics-space. Tailing the logs from the Apps Manager will
ensure getting the startup logs for the Nozzle, which are typically lost when using `cf logs. Follow this
procedure:

1. Set APPD_DEBUG to **true** in the Apps Manager under Settings/User Provided Environment
Variables.

    #![](./images/pcf-foundation-06.png)#

    This will cause the agent logs to be forwarded to standard err rather than written to the container file
    system, so they’ll be visible in the app logs.

2. Restage the Nozzle in the Apps Manager.

3. In the Apps Manager, go to Logs and press the play button to tail the logs as the Nozzle
restages. You should see some [ERR] log messages in red that are specific to the SDK agent and
would indicate any problems communicating with the Controller. The [OUT] log messages should
show ‘Handling x events’ where x is non-zero and would indicate successful communication with the
Loggregator Firehose.

### <a id='Nozzle Credentials'></a> Validating the Dashboard App

Check that the KPI health rules have been created in the appd-nozzle-v2 app in the controller configured
in the tile under **Nozzle Configuration**. Navigate to Applications/appd-nozzle-v2/Alert & Respond/**Health Rules**.
You should see a set of over 100 health rules whose names are prefixed with the system domain of the PCF foundation
where the tile was installed.

Open the the Single Foundation dashboard under **Dashboards & Reports** with the name `appd-nozzle-v2-<system domain>-PCF`
KPI Dashboard and check that there are no broken links and the widgets are showing recent data.

If any Multi-foundation dashboards were configured, check that they are also listed under Dashboards & Reports,
with the name `<config name>-PCF Multi-foundation Dashboard`.

If the health rules or dashboards are not listed, restage and check the logs for the Dashboard App `appdpcfdashboard-<version>` in
the **Apps Manager** under the org and space appdynamics-org/appdynamcis-space, as was described for the Nozzle.
Optionally set the APPD_DEBUG flag to true.

The Dashboard App requires that the Nozzle successfully publish metrics to the Controller before it will create the KPI health rules and dashboards.
If the Dashboard App does not find the metrics, it will output a message to its log:


    "retrying fetching metrics exponentially"

and eventually:

      “error: failed to find PCF metric path in target controller…”

If you see these messages, first resolve the issue with the Nozzle by following the Nozzle validation steps described above.


## <a id='Scaling'></a> AppDynamics Nozzle Scalability

Starting with the 4.6.* version of the tile, AppDynamics Nozzle is completely scalable to any number of desired instances. However,
it is recommended to scale the number of nozzle instances to match the number of traffic controller instances.
See the [official cloud foundry recommendation](https://docs.cloudfoundry.org/loggregator/log-ops-guide.html#scaling-nozzles).


## <a id='deploy-multiple-tiles-on-multiple-instances'></a> Multiple PCF Foundations

Multiple AppDynamics Platform Monitoring tiles can be deployed on multiple PCF foundations, using a single AppDynamics Controller.
The metrics corresponding to each of the foundations are recorded under tier names which defaults to the system domain’s value of the Cloud Foundry deployment, for example: `sys.pie-multi-az-blue.cfplatformeng.com`
Optionally, the tier names can be customized by setting `Nozzle Tier Name` field in the **Overriding Defaults** form.
