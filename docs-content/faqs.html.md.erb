## <a id='GeneralFAQs'></a> General FAQs
### <a id='g1'></a> <a id='g1'></a> What is included in the AppDynamics Platform Metrics for VMware Tanzu tile?
   * AppDynamics VMware Tanzu FireHose Nozzle Agent. The Agent collects VMware Tanzu metrics through a custom Nozzle from Loggregator.
   * AppDynamics VMware Tanzu Dashboard. This is an auto-generated custom dashboard that creates health rules for the above VMware Tanzu metrics and presents it on the Controller.

### <a id='g3'></a> How do I configure SSL (On-Prem Controller deployment)?
   *  Include the entire certificate chain in the security configuration of the BOSH Director tile.
      This ensures that the BOSH deployments and Diego cells have automatic access
      to the certificates while validating the SSL connection.
   *  AppDynamics deployments automatically reads the certificates and imports them into the correct key stores. No additional steps are required.
   *  Use the exact format (no comments) as specified in the Pivotal Ops Manager documentation.
   *  Select all the SSL check boxes in the Tile Configuration Forms.

### <a id='g4'></a> How do I configure SSL (SAAS deployment)?
   *   AppDynamics SAAS Controllers are signed with standard DigiCerts CA.
       They are already included in the BOSH deployments and application containers.
   *   Select all the SSL check boxes in the Tile Configuration Forms.

### <a id='g5'></a> My installation failed, what do I provide to the AppDynamics support?
   *  Collect the error logs from the Ops Manager installation page and provide the entire deployment log files to the AppDynamics support.

## <a id='PCFDashboardFAQS'></a> AppDynamics Platform Metrics for VMware Tanzu FAQs
### <a id='d1'></a> What is VMware Tanzu Dashboard?
  * The VMware Tanzu Dashboard Generator is a Python 3 application that generates a platform dashboard and set of health rules for the VMware Tanzu foundations that have installed the AppDynamics tile v4.5.x. The generated dashboard and health rules leverage the custom metrics published by the AppDynamics tile to the Controller and application configured in the AppDynamics tile.

### <a id='d2'></a> Where do I find this Dashboard?
 * The dashboard can be found in the Dashboards and Reports page of the AppDynamics Controller, with a name `{appname}-{tiername}-PCF KPI Dashboard` where appname and tiername are the names of Nozzle Agent and tier name you have configured in the tile.

### <a id='d3'></a> How is this Dashboard created?
   * The Dashboard application reads the KPI metrics emitted by the Nozzle Agent in the tile and associates them with various auto-generated health rules and renders a neat custom dashboard.

### <a id='d5'></a> I do not see this dashboard, how do I troubleshoot?
   * Ensure that the application is deployed properly. You should see `appdpcfdashboard-version` running if the application is successfully deployed.

  ```bash
      $ cf target -o appdynamics-org -s appdynamics-space
      $ cf apps
          Getting apps in org appdynamics-org / space appdynamics-space as admin...
      name                       requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls
      appdpcfdashboard-4.4.337   started           1/1         128M     1G      appdpcfdashboard.cfapps.pie-20.cfplatformeng.com
  ```
### <a id='d6'></a> Where do I find the logs?
  * Run `cf logs appdpcfdashboard-{version}` in `appdynamics-org` and `appdynamics-space`.

### <a id='d7'></a> Can I redirect the logs?
  * To redirect the logs to use STDERR, use the [Overriding Default Nozzle Configuration](./using.html) environment variable `APPD_DEBUG`. Setting it to `true` will direct AppDynamics Agent logs to STDERR instead of log files.

    ```bash
        $ cf set-env appdnozzle-4.5.489 APPD_DEBUG true`.
        $ cf restage appdnozzle-4.5.489
    ```
### <a id='d8'></a> How do I troubleshoot an SSL issue?
  * Run `$ cf ssh  appdpcfdashboard-{version}`
  * Make sure that the correct certificate is present in the `/home/vcap/app/cert.pem` file of the application.

     Run `cat /home/vcap/app/cert.pem`

### <a id='d9'></a> How do I change a configuration variable?
  * The application is configured by using environment variables. To override, run `$ cf set-env appdpcfdashboard-{version} {ENVNAME} {ENVVAR}`
  * The list of environment varibles can be found by running `$ cf env appdpcfdashboard-{version}`

### <a id='d10'></a> How do I troubleshoot a tile install?
  * It’s not uncommon that in production environments cf ssh access is not allowed. In this case, under Settings/User Provided Environment Variables, set `APPD_DEBUG` to true for the appdnozzle app in the Apps Manager, or use the `cf set-env` command and restart the app. This setting forwards the agent logs to STDOUT, so you’ll be able to view them in the Apps Manager or using `cf logs APP_NAME`.
