## <a id='GeneralFAQs'></a> General FAQs
### <a id='g1'></a> <a id='g1'></a> What is included in the AppDynamics Tile?
   * AppDynamics PCF FireHose Nozzle Agent. The Agent collects PCF metrics through a custom Nozzle from loggregator.
   * AppDynamics PCF Dashboard. This is an autogenerated custom dashboard that creates healthrules for the above PCF metrics and presents it on the Controller.

### <a id='g3'></a> How do I configure SSL (On-Prem Controller deployment)?
   *  Include the entire certificate chain in the security configuration of the Ops Manager Director Tile. This will ensure that the BOSH deployments and Diego cells have automatic access to the certificates while validating the SSL connection.
   *  AppDynamics deployments automatically reads the certificates and imports them into the correct key stores. No additional steps are required.
   *  Use the exact format (no comments) as specified in the Pivotal Ops Manager documentation.
   *  Select all the SSL check boxes in the Tile Configuration Forms.

### <a id='g4'></a> How do I configure SSL (SAAS deployment)?
   *   AppDynamics SAAS Controllers are signed with standard DigiCerts CA. They are already included in the BOSH deployments and applicaiton containers.
   *   Select all the SSL check boxes in the Tile Configuration Forms.

### <a id='g5'></a> My installation failed, what do I provide to the AppDynamics support?
   *  Collect the error logs from the Ops Manager installation page and provide the entire deployment log files to the AppDynamics support.

## <a id='PCFDashboardFAQS'></a> AppDynamics PCF Dashboard FAQs
### <a id='d1'></a> What is PCF Dashboard?
  * The PCF Dashboard Generator is a Python 3 application that generates a platform dashboard and set of health rules for the PCF foundations that have installed the AppDynamics Tile v4.5.x. The generated dashboard and health rules leverage the custom metrics published by the AppDynamics Tile to the Controller and application configured in the AppDynamics Tile.

### <a id='d2'></a> Where do I find this Dashboard?
 * The dashboard can be found in the Dashboards and Reports page of the AppDynamics Controller, with a name `{appname}-{tiername}-PCF KPI Dashboard` where appname and tiername are the names of Nozzle Agent and tier name you have configured in the Tile.

### <a id='d3'></a> How does this Dashboard is created?
   * The Dashboard application reads the KPI metrics emitted by the Nozzle Agent in the Tile and associates them with various auto-generated healthrules and renders a neat custom dashboard.

### <a id='d5'></a> I dont see this dashboard, how do I troubleshoot?
   * Ensure that the application is deployed properly. You should see `appdpcfdashboard-version` running if the application is successfully deployed.

  ```bash
      $ cf target -o appdynamics-org -s appdynamics-space
      $ cf apps
          Getting apps in org appdynamics-org / space appdynamics-space as admin...
      name                       requested state   instances   memory   disk   urls

  ```
### <a id='d6'></a> Where do I find the logs?
  * Run `cf logs appdpcfdashboard-{version}` in `appdynamics-org` and `appdynamics-space`.

### <a id='d7'></a> How do I troubleshoot an SSL issue?
   * Run `$ cf ssh  appdpcfdashboard-{version}``
   * make sure that the correct certificate is present in the `/home/vcap/app/cert.pem` file of the application.

     Run `cat /home/vcap/app/cert.pem`

### <a id='d8'></a> How do I change a configuration variable?
  * The application is configured by using environment variables. To override, run `$ cf set-env appdpcfdashboard-{version} {ENVNAME} {ENVVAR}`
  * The list of environment varibles can be found by running `$ cf env appdpcfdashboard-{version}`
